The code is placed in AbdulMoqeet branch, and do configure SFML in IDE (preferably Visual Studio) before cloning
This game is a 6/4/2 player ludo game created in c++ and Graphics created using SFML library, 
this beautiful game is a result of me and my friend Amna's tiresome efforts and dedication to complete this project assigned by our
professor as a final Project of our OOP course
